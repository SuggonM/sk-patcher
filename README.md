# sk-patcher
A tiny patcher script for [Soul Knight](https://soulknight.chillyroom.com/). It simply runs a set of [substitutions](./substitutions.sed) on the user's local data to unlock various contents.

Intended for experimental purposes ONLY.

## Usage
In [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)-alike environment:
```
$ sudo ./patcher.sh
```

OR in your superuser or root-enabled ADB shell:
```
# ./patcher.sh
```
